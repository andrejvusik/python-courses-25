# * Task 9. Caesar Cipher
# The user enters a string and a number N (can be either positive or negative).
# Write a program that encrypts the string using the Caesar Cipher.
# The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the
# original text is shifted up or down the alphabet by N positions.
# Example:
# Enter N: 3
# Enter text: hello
# Result: khoor
# Explanation:
# In the word hello, each letter is shifted by 3 positions in the alphabet.
# Thus, h becomes k (alphabet a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z),
# e becomes h, l becomes o, o becomes r.
